Abstract = {{Numerous studies on active mountain ranges have demonstrated the
   interaction between tectonics and climate in shaping topography. Here we
   explore how variations in rock types have affected the topographic
   development of the Pyrenees since cessation of orogenesis ca. 20 Ma. Our
   study is based on a multidisciplinary approach and integrates
   topographic analyses, rock strength measurements and thermal modelling
   of low-temperature thermochronological data published across the Central
   Pyrenees. Results indicate a strong influence of rock strength in
   determining the post-orogenic morphology of the Pyrenees. We observe a
   correlation between rock strength and the normalized channel steepness
   index (k(sn)) of the different lithologies. Moreover, the highest
   topography is dominated by the Variscan plutonic massifs which have
   highest rock strength. Consequently, the drainage divide appears to
   track the position of these massifs. Abrupt deceleration of exhumation
   recorded in inverse modelling of low-temperature thermochronologic data
   suggests that the exhumation of the Variscan massifs also played role in
   lowering in erosion rates over the massifs during orogenesis. Crown

Title = {{A segmentation approach for the reproducible extraction and

Abstract = {{Changes in the steepness of river profiles or abrupt vertical steps
   (i.e. waterfalls) are thought to be indicative of changes in erosion
   rates, lithology or other factors that affect landscape evolution. These
   changes are referred to as knickpoints or knickzones and are pervasive
   in bedrock river systems. Such features are thought to reveal
   information about landscape evolution and patterns of erosion, and
   therefore their locations are often reported in the geomorphic
   literature. It is imperative that studies reporting knickpoints and
   knickzones use a reproducible method of quantifying their locations, as
   their number and spatial distribution play an important role in
   interpreting tectonically active landscapes. In this contribution we
   introduce a reproducible knickpoint and knickzone extraction algorithm
   that uses river profiles transformed by integrating drainage area along
   channel length (the so-called integral or chi method). The profile is
   then statistically segmented and the differing slopes and step changes
   in the elevations of these segments are used to identify knickpoints,
   knickzones and their relative magnitudes. The output locations of
   identified knickpoints and knickzones compare favourably with human
   mapping: we test the method on Santa Cruz Island, CA, using previously
   reported knickzones and also test the method against a new dataset from
   the Quadrilatero Ferrifero in Brazil. The algorithm allows for the
   extraction of varying knickpoint morphologies, including stepped,
   positive slope-break (concave upward) and negative slope-break
   knickpoints. We identify parameters that most affect the resulting
   knickpoint and knickzone locations and provide guidance for both usage
   and outputs of the method to produce reproducible knickpoint datasets.}},

Abstract = {{For over a century, geomorphologists have attempted to unravel
   information about landscape evolution, and processes that drive it,
   using river profiles. Many studies have combined new topographic
   datasets with theoretical models of channel incision to infer erosion
   rates, identify rock types with different resistance to erosion, and
   detect potential regions of tectonic activity. The most common metric
   used to analyse river profile geometry is channel steepness, or k(s).
   However, the calculation of channel steepness requires the normalisation
   of channel gradient by drainage area. This normalisation requires a
   power law exponent that is referred to as the channel concavity index.
   Despite the concavity index being crucial in determining channel
   steepness, it is challenging to constrain. In this contribution, we
   compare both slope-area methods for calculating the concavity index and
   methods based on integrating drainage area along the length of the
   channel, using so-called ``chi{''} (chi) analysis. We present a new
   chi-based method which directly compares chi values of tributary nodes
   to those on the main stem; this method allows us to constrain the
   concavity index in transient landscapes without assuming a linear
   relationship between chi and elevation. Patterns of the concavity index
   have been linked to the ratio of the area and slope exponents of the
   stream power incision model (m/n); we therefore construct simple
   numerical models obeying detachment-limited stream power and test the
   different methods against simulations with imposed m and n. We find that
   chi-based methods are better than slope-area methods at reproducing
   imposed m/n ratios when our numerical landscapes are subject to either
   transient uplift or spatially varying uplift and fluvial erodibility. We
   also test our methods on several real landscapes, including sites with
   both lithological and structural heterogeneity, to provide examples of
   the methods' performance and limitations. These methods are made
   available in a new software package so that other workers can explore
   how the concavity index varies across diverse landscapes, with the aim
   to improve our understanding of the physics behind bedrock channel
   incision.}},
